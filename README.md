# Convex Hull Algorithms

## Basic information
This repository contains parallel CPU and GPU implementations of algorithms solving the convex hull problem in C++ using the OpenMP API, CUDA API, and the Thrust library.

It has been developed in 2023 as a part of my master's thesis at the CTU University in Prague.
